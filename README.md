# BE_RESEARCH_HF - Hyperledger Fabric Research Repository

Welcome to the BE_RESEARCH_HF repository! This is a research project repository for Hyperledger Fabric. Please take a moment to read this README to understand how to work with this project.

## Branches

  **Important**: Do not push any changes to the master branch, as it is the foundation of the code.

  **Important**: Do not push sensitive information such as IDs, keys, or private variables. You can remove these using `./networkDown.sh` or add them in `.gitignore`

  **Important**: Please follow proper coding standards and maintain consistent file and folder naming to ensure code readability.

- **Master Branch**: The master branch serves as the base of the project, containing network configuration and Caliper connection details. To clone it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  git clone -b master https://github.com/Nilesh0711/BE_RESEARCH_HF.git
  ```

### Kafka, Raft, Solo Branches

- Create separate branches for Kafka, Raft, and Solo configurations.

### Test Network Branches

- For each test network and benchmark with Caliper reports, create new branches.
- Each branch must include network configurations and Caliper benchmark reports in PDF format.


## Chaincode

The chaincode of the project remains the same for all benchmarks.

## Caliper
 
- Write test scripts for all functions in your chaincode. In the base branch, I have only included test scripts for CreateAsset and ReadAsset. Expand your testing to cover all functions.

- Refer to the Hyperledger Caliper tutorials linked in the "Resources" section for a clear understanding of how to write benchmark scripts using Caliper.

- Before starting the Docker containers for Caliper, ensure that you include the crypto-config file in the network folder of Caliper. This is essential for configuring the network properly.


## Crypto Materials

- Cryptogen is used for generating cryptographic materials. The Certificate Authority (CA) is not used in this project.
