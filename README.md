# BE_RESEARCH_HF - Hyperledger Fabric Research Repository

Welcome to the BE_RESEARCH_HF repository! This is a research project repository for Hyperledger Fabric. Please take a moment to read this README to understand how to work with this project.

## Branches

- **Master Branch**: The master branch serves as the base of the project, containing network configuration and Caliper connection details. To clone it, use the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone -b master https://github.com/Nilesh0711/BE_RESEARCH_HF.git
   ```

   **Important**: Do not push any changes to the master branch, as it is the foundation of the code.

   **Important**: Do not push sensitive information such as IDs, keys, or private variables. You can remove these using `./networkDown.sh`.

   **Important**: Please follow proper coding standards and maintain consistent file and folder naming to ensure code readability.

- **Kafka, Raft, Solo Branches**: Create separate branches for Kafka, Raft, and Solo configurations.

- **Test Network Branches**: For each test network and benchmark with Caliper reports, create new branches.

## Chaincode

The chaincode of the project remains the same for all benchmarks.

## Crypto Materials

- Cryptogen is used for generating cryptographic materials. The Certificate Authority (CA) is not used in this project.
