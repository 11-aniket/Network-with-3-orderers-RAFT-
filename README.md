# BE_RESEARCH_HF - Hyperledger Fabric Research Repository

Welcome to the BE_RESEARCH_HF repository! This is a research project repository for Hyperledger Fabric. Please take a moment to read this README to understand how to work with this project.

## Prerequisites
Before you start working with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Hyperledger Fabric Bin Files**: You need to have the binary files of Hyperledger Fabric. You can refer to the official Hyperledger Fabric documentation for installation instructions. Here's the official link: [Hyperledger Fabric Documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)

    **YouTube Tutorials**:

    - [Part 2 Setup](https://youtu.be/rSBkmsnvipI?si=Tev-5PhxCol1pqSI)

- **Setting PATH**: Make sure to set the path for the bin folder in your environment. You can do this by editing your `~/.bashrc` file.

   Example:
   ```sh
   gedit ~/.bashrc
   # or
   nano ~/.bashrc

## Network Start

Before you start the network, make sure to follow all the steps mentioned in the prerequisites section and verify the version.

To start and stop the network, you can use the following scripts:

- **Start Network**: Run the script `./networkUp.sh` to start the network. This script will set up the necessary components for your Hyperledger Fabric network.

- **Stop Network**: You can use the script `./networkDown.sh` to stop the network. This script will remove various components, including IDs and private keys, to clean up your environment.

Please note that you may need to add the missing path to folders in the `./networkUp.sh` and `./networkDown.sh` scripts. Ensure that all the required paths and dependencies are correctly configured in these scripts before running them.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage your Hyperledger Fabric network and start or stop it as needed for your research or project.

## Branches

  **Important**: Do not push any changes to the master branch, as it is the foundation of the code.

  **Important**: Do not push sensitive information such as IDs, keys, or private variables. You can remove these using `./networkDown.sh` or add them in `.gitignore`

  **Important**: Please follow proper coding standards and maintain consistent file and folder naming to ensure code readability.

- **Master Branch**: The master branch serves as the base of the project, containing network configuration and Caliper connection details. To clone it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  git clone -b master https://github.com/Nilesh0711/BE_RESEARCH_HF.git
  ```
  
### Kafka, Raft, Solo Branches

- Create separate branches for Kafka, Raft, and Solo configurations.

### Test Network Branches

- For each test network and benchmark with Caliper reports, create new branches.
- Each branch must include network configurations and Caliper benchmark reports in PDF format.


## Chaincode

The chaincode of the project remains the same for all benchmarks.

## Caliper
 
- Write test scripts for all functions in your chaincode. In the base branch, I have only included test scripts for CreateAsset and ReadAsset. Expand your testing to cover all functions.

- Refer to the Hyperledger Caliper tutorials linked in the "Resources" section for a clear understanding of how to write benchmark scripts using Caliper.

- Before starting the Docker containers for Caliper, ensure that you include the crypto-config file in the network folder of Caliper. This is essential for configuring the network properly.


## Crypto Materials

- Cryptogen is used for generating cryptographic materials. The Certificate Authority (CA) is not used in this project.
